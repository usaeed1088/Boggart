# transport
A cross-platform multi-medium data transport framework.
The goal of this project is to create a cross-platform data transport library which is capable of connecting multiple devices across different mediums (RS-232, RS-485, TCP, UDP, Xbee etc) through a unified interface.

The library is currently under heavy development and builds only for Windows based systems. Support for Linux will soon be added.
In the meanwhile, refer to the TransportApp to have a glimpse of amazing interface and to see 'Transport' in action.

Contributions are welcomed.
