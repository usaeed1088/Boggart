# Boggart
We live in a connected world. Everything needs and wants to be connected with every other thing. There are a lot of interfaces to provide connectivity e.g, Bluetooth, Wifi, Serial. On top of these interfaces there are multiple protocols e.g, HDLC, TCP, UDP, MQTT, CoAP etc. All these interfaces and protocols have a simple common goal i.e, to provide connectivity and a medium for data exchange between applications running on the devices.
The goal of Boggart is to build a simple API on top of these interfaces and protocols for a simplified device-to-device communication. Boggart is an effort for decoupling application logic from data transport logic. It is being built on top of a Platform Abstraction Layer to provide cross-platform support.

Inspiration for the name 'Boggart' comes from Harry Potter where a Boggart can take any shape. The Boggart API will be capable to assume any shape over the network (don't be afraid :P) as it will be capable to run over any transport medium and any type of OS.

The library is currently under heavy development and builds only for Windows based systems. Support for Linux will soon be added.
In the meanwhile, refer to the BoggartApplication to have a glimpse of amazing interface and to see 'Boggart' in action.

Contributions are welcomed.
